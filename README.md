Countries have been grouped according to regions defined in the EU's Eurovoc (listed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovoc)).

A mapping from country names to ISO 3166-1 codes has been downloaded from [DataHub](https://datahub.io/core/country-list).

The colour scheme used has been informed by this helpful [article](https://blog.datawrapper.de/partycolors/) from Datawrapper, and draws inspiration from The Guardian's choice of political colours for presenting the results of the [2019 EU elections](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2019/may/26/eu-election-results-2019-across-europe).
